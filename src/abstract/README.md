# Abstract Algebra

This sublibrary has nothing to do with machine learning. It is in PyPearl 1 because I want to use nd arrays, 2 because I want to follow through with it. It will likely go on my resume as a different project and by all accounts is it's own thing. Idk maybe I'll tie it back to ML eventually. I don't know how that would work but I kinda want to make it. Like a dihedral classifier.
